# PyBank Analysis Project

This project analyzes financial data to determine the total number of months, total revenue, average change in profits/losses, greatest increase in profits, and greatest decrease in profits over the period.

## Project Structure

Pybank/
│
├── Analysis/
│ └── analysis.txt # Output file with the financial analysis results
│
├── Resources/
│ └── budget_data.csv # Input data file with financial information
│
└── Main.py # Main script for processing the financial data


## How to Run

1. **Ensure the directory structure is as follows:**
    - `Pybank/Analysis/` (The folder where the results text file will be saved)
    - `Pybank/Resources/` (The folder containing the `budget_data.csv` file)
    - `Pybank/Main.py` (The main script)

2. **Run the script:**
    - Execute the `Main.py` script. It will read the `budget_data.csv` file, perform the analysis, and generate the `analysis.txt` file in the `Analysis` folder.

## Output

The results of the financial analysis will be printed to the terminal and saved in a text file named `analysis.txt` located in the `Analysis` folder. The results include:
- Total number of months
- Total revenue
- Average change in profits/losses
- Greatest increase in profits
- Greatest decrease in profits



# Election Analysis Project

This project analyzes election data and determines the total number of votes, vote count and percentage for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## How to Run

1. **Ensure the directory structure is as follows:**
    - `Pypoll/Analysis/` (The folder where the results text file will be saved)
    - `Pypoll/Resources/` (The folder containing the `election_data.csv` file)
    - `Pypoll/Main.py` (The main script)

2. **Run the script:**
    - Execute the `Main.py` script. It will read the `election_data.csv` file, perform the analysis, and generate the `election_results.txt` file in the `Analysis` folder.

## Output

The results of the election analysis will be printed to the terminal and saved in a text file named `election_results.txt` located in the `Analysis` folder. The results include:
- Total number of votes
- Vote count and percentage for each candidate
- The winner of the election

## Author

This code was authored by me usi g the material learned in class. During the development of this project, I investigated various Python functionalities to export the results to a text file. I used resources such as [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) for Python functions and ChatGPT for additional concepts like storing multiple lines in a results variable.
